In your line, you wrote `string[i] '-a'+'A'`, which is missing an operator between `string[i]` and `'-a'`.\n\n# Hints/Guidance\nCheck that line and make sure you are using the correct operator (like `+` or `-`) between `string[i]` and `'-a'`. Review how you are converting between uppercase and lowercase letters, and ensure each part of the calculation is separated by an operator."}]}
